/**
 * The reverse Cuthill-Mckee method is a fast and effective preconditioner for reducing the bandwidth of sparse linear systems.
 * When solving a positive semidefinite linear system using Cholesky factorization, it greatly reduces fill-in.
 * It is a direct conversion to TS from {@link github.com/mikolalysenko/cuthill-mckee}
 * @param list - lower triangular non zeros from a symmetric sparse matrix.
 * @param dimension - matrix dimension
 * @returns A Float64Array where the value at each index represents the new position of the node
 *          in the bandwidth-reduced ordering.
